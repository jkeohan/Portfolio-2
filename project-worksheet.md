## Project Description

My final project will have a navigation bar with my name to the left and the page navigations to the right. I really like Matt Farley's profile and he has his own icon to the left of his navigation. If I have time, I would like to make my own icon. Like Eloise Barrow's website, the navigation bar will stay at the top when the user scrolls and change the hihglighted portion based on which part they are at. Just like Jessica and Eloise, my portofolio will be one page and the navigation bar will take the user down the page to the part the user clicked on. Under my navigation, I want something that gets people's attention. I really like how the profile from https://jacekjeznach.com/ starts and how the letters also react when the mouse hovers over them. I would like to add a banner under the navigation with my job title and the letter reacting under the mouse hover. My about section will include a photo and brief description of myself. Like Matt Farley, I want 3 projects in each row in my projects section. There will be a preview image of each project and the preview will change when the user hovers over each item. I want the hover to reveal which skills I used in each project. I got this idea of having the skills from Andrew Hollingworth's profile, however I want a hover effect like Matt Farley's profile. Next I will have a contact section with a form and my social media icons, and then a footer to end the page.

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.

## Time/Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Priority` Matix.  This involves drawing a a square.  In the middle of the square, on the x axis draw a line.  The most left part of the line should start with 0hrs and the end of the line should include 2hrs.  This line will be used to estimate how much time any one feature will take to complete.

Now draw a vertical line on the y axis.  The top of this line should have `High` and the bottom `Low`.  This line will be used to assign a priority to to each feature you wish to include in the project.  

Now create a separate list starting with A and assign it one of the features.  Continue to assign each feature a letter.  Once complete add each letter to the matrix assigning based on what your feel it's prioirty is an how long it will take to implement. If any one feature takes longer than 2hrs to complete than break it down into smaller tasks and reassign them a new letter.

Once complete tally up the time and determine how long the project will take to complete. Now break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo.

Total number of hours: 39.5 hours

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP

MVP List:
[x] Hamburger navigation
[ ] regular navigation, set up html in flex, responsive, make project section, API, form, make other sections, social media icons, and project preview changes when hovered over.


#### PostMVP
PostMVP List: Learn Bootstrap, Materialize, make letters wiggle in banner, make banner interactive, make my own icon, carousel.


## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Hamburger | MVP | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
| Project Previews | MVP | 3hr | -hr | -hr|
| Regular Nav | MVP | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
| Adding Form | MVP | 1.5hr| -hr | -hr |
| Other sections and flex| MVP | 4hr | -hr | -hr|
| Working with API | MVP | 3hrs| -hr | -hr |
| Responsive | MVP | 3hr | -hr | -hr|
| Social Media Icons | MVP | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
| Project Hover | PMVP | 3hr | -hr | -hr|

| Bootstrap | PMVP | 4hr | -hr | -hr|
